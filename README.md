# Fancy seeing you here!

I am a front-end developer who focuses on accessibility, performance, and UX at Empire Life. 

- ☀️     I am part of [Portals](https://github.com/EmpireLife/empire-portal) team by day.
- 🌙    Along with [Eric](https://github.com/emperic) and [Jeff](https://github.com/empire-jlee), I manage [Empire UI](https://empirelife.github.io/empire-ui/?path=/story/status-page--default) by night. We'd love to have you as a [collaborator](https://github.com/EmpireLife/empire-ui)! 🤝
- 💬    I am helping [Scott](https://github.com/ScottGibsonEmpire) with his [Notification Kit](https://github.com/EmpireLife/notification-kit) library in order to keep it up to date with our Design System.
- ♿    I am also helping project managers throughout Empire Life improve accessibility ratings for their products.
- 🌐    Eric, Wendy and I actively work together to keep our company wide [Design System](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c7c41e6a-accb-48da-413e-83b7dba9193c-b1f5/screen/f2a8f614-8803-4ec5-b117-d40fa1279da5/) up to date.
- 😴    Sometimes, I procrastinate by looking for ways to implement performance hacks and shave microseconds off of our site's load times.
- 👋    I am fairly active on EmpireLife Slack. Hit me up if you have questions about accessibility, design, or front-end stuff! Or if you just want to chat 💁‍♂️
