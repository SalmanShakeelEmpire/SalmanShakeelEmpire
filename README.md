# Fancy seeing you here!

I am a front-end developer who focuses on accessibility, performance, and UX at Empire Life. 

- ☀️     I am part of Portals team by day.
- 🌙    Along with [Eric](https://github.com/emperic) and [Jeff](https://github.com/empire-jlee), I manage [Empire UI](https://empirelife.github.io/empire-ui/?path=/story/status-page--default) by night. We'd love to have you as a collaborator! 🤝
- ♿    I am also helping improve accessibility ratings for multiple projects across Empire Life. 
- 😴    Sometimes, I procrastinate by looking for ways to implement performance hacks and shave microseconds off of our site's load times.
- 💬    I am fairly active on EmpireLife Slack. Hit me up if you have questions about accessibility, design, or front-end stuff! Or if you just want to chat 💁‍♂️
